# Piccolo2020

The manuscript by Piccolo et al (2020) is in press at the journal
*Gigascience*.  <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/675181v1>



# CODECHECKER notes.

The main Rmd and helper script were downloaded from
<https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/>. 

The data files were downloaded direct from the CODEOCEAN capsule.  One
of the data files
`Results_ParamsOptimized/diabetes/Nested_Predictions.tsv.gz` needed to
be compressed to reduce the file size from 160 Mb to 9 Mb (Github has
limit on individual files of 100 Mb.)

A few small edits were made to the `Analyze_Results.Rmd`, see history.

To regenerate the Figures/ folder, we simply ran `make run` in the
Makefile.
